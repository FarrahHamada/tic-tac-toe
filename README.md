# Tic-Tac-Toe
 #### Project Goal - I  designed a functional game utilizing object-oriented procedures. This game has two players, each can take their turn with a click of a square. Once there are three of the same in a row the game generates a winner! A "New Game" button allows for the game to be reset and replayed.
